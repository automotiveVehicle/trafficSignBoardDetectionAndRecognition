# Traffic Sign Board Detection And Recognition

  A vehicle that can sense its surroundings and navigate on its own is called an autonomous vehicle. Autonomous vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, and advanced algorithms to collect data about their surroundings and make decisions about where to go and how to avoid obstacles.
  
  Traffic sign board detection is a critical aspect of autonomous vehicle technology. It involves using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify and interpret traffic signs in real-time. This allows the vehicle to understand and respond to various road rules and conditions, ensuring safe and efficient navigation.
