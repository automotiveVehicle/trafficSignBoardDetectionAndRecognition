# Traffic Sign Board Detection And Recognition

  A vehicle that can sense its surroundings and navigate on its own is called an autonomous vehicle. Autonomous vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, and advanced algorithms to collect data about their surroundings and make decisions about where to go and how to avoid obstacles.
  
  Traffic sign board detection is a critical aspect of autonomous vehicle technology. It involves using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify and interpret traffic signs in real-time. This allows the vehicle to understand and respond to various road rules and conditions, ensuring safe and efficient navigation.

# Introduction
The traffic sign placed at the side of the roads provides information about route guide,road condition and hazards. In adverse traffic condition the driver may not notice traffic signs which may cause accidents and loss of properties to avoid this many control device has been proposed which alert the driver about the traffic signs.The capability to identify traffic signs and act on them is one of the most important components of a self-driving
automobile.

A traffic sign board detection and recognition system is needed to accurately identifyand interpret traffic signs in real-time, in order to improve road safety and facilitate compliance with traffic regulations. By automatically detecting and interpreting trafficsigns, this system can help drivers to make informed decisions and reduce the likelihood of accidents or violations. Furthermore, a traffic sign detection and recognition system can also provide useful information to traffic management systems and assist with the efficient flow of traffic.

# Objectives
1. Create an algorithm that can detect traffic sign board from live video feed.
2. Detect the location of sign board in live feed.
3. Classify the detected sign board .
4. Display the annotated and labelled live feed.
